## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Disaster Response & Safe Zone Locator üåç
### Overview:
This is a web or mobile app that helps users find safe zones, hospitals, and emergency services during natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, wildfires, etc.) using real-time geolocation data.

### How It Works:
1. User shares their location (or manually inputs it).
2. App fetches real-time disaster data (from APIs like NASA Disaster API, ReliefWeb, etc.).
3. Safe zones and emergency shelters appear on the map (using OpenStreetMap data).
4. App suggests the safest route to the nearest safe zone, avoiding blocked roads or dangerous areas.
5. Users get emergency contacts (local fire stations, hospitals, NGOs, etc.).
6. (Optional) User can report unsafe zones or request help, which is added to a live feed.

### Tech Stack & APIs:
1. Frontend: React.js (Web) or React Native (Mobile).
2. Backend: Node.js/Python (FastAPI).
3. APIs:
- OpenStreetMap (for geolocation & navigation).
- NASA Disaster API (for real-time disaster alerts).
- ReliefWeb API (for humanitarian response data).
- Google Places API (for emergency services & hospitals).
- Hosting: Vercel/Netlify (Frontend), Firebase/AWS (Backend).

### Why It Stands Out?
- Life-saving potential ‚Äì People in disaster-prone areas can use it in real-time.
- Highly relevant ‚Äì Governments, NGOs, and citizens can benefit.
- Strong innovation factor ‚Äì Combines geolocation + real-time disaster tracking.
